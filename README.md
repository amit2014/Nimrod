# Welcome to Nimrod
Nimrod is a lead generation bot that helps you find the emails of people you want to reach out to.

You hand Nimrod a google spreadsheet with the details of your prospects, and it fills in their emails from several tools for you.

## Setup

* To get started, get a list of prospects in a google spreadsheet. [Click here to get a sample template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1NTHbSxdr9PMKXf-wpWwaT44FR8YuLqRMPrURWwvaGC0/edit). It’s important that you do not change the format of the columns
* Clone this repo in a local folder
### If you are using mac, you will already have ruby pre-installed on your machine
* Run these commands in terminal:
```
gem install google_drive
brew install phantomjs
gem install watir-webdriver
```
* If you don't have Homebrew installed, run:
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
### If you are using windows:
* Install Ruby with [Ruby Installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
* Install [DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/add-ons/devkit/)
* Install [phantomjs](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-2.1.1-windows.zip)
* Then run `gem install watir-webdriver`
### Now that the setup is done,
* Navigate to the Nimrod folder and open it in your favourite code editor
* Fill in your details in `@your_config`
* The google spreadsheet keys can be found in the URL. It’s the alphanumeric keys between `d/` and  `/edit` in the URL
* Open the `gdrive_config.json` file and enter your google `client_id` & `client_secret`. [Follow this guide to get them](http://www.scrappycabin.com/guides/google-drive-authorisation/)
* You’re good to go. Run:
```
ruby Nimrod.rb &
```
